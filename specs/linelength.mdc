- Lines shouldn't exceed 80 columns in most cases.
- Exceptions are fine, but they shouldn't be the rule.
- Bad:
  ```go
  id, err = store.CreateUser(api.User{Login: "octocat",HTMLURL: "https://github.com/octocat", IsOrg: false, })
  ```
- Good:
  ```go
  id, err = store.CreateUser(api.User{
      Login:   "octocat",
      HTMLURL: "https://github.com/octocat",
      IsOrg:   false,
  }
  ```
