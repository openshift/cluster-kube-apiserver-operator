          A workload (pod, deployment, deamonset, ...) was created somewhere in the cluster but it
          did not match the PodSecurity "{{ $labels.policy_level }}" profile defined by its namespace either via the cluster-wide
          configuration (which triggers on a "restricted" profile violations) or by the namespace
          local Pod Security labels.
          Refer to Kubernetes documentation on Pod Security Admission to learn more about these
          violations.
