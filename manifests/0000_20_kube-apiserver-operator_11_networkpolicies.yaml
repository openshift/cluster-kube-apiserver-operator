# Default-deny policy for the openshift-kube-apiserver-operator namespace.
# This policy selects all pods in the namespace and enables default-deny for both
# ingress and egress by specifying policyTypes without any allow rules.
#
# NetworkPolicies are additive (use OR logic):
# - This policy enables default-deny for all pods
# - Subsequent policies add specific allow rules
# - If any policy allows traffic, that traffic is permitted
# - Policies cannot override or block traffic allowed by other policies
#
# Without this policy, all pods would have unrestricted network access (allow-all).

# Allow egress to the Kubernetes API server.

# - Manage pods, services, and other resources in the openshift-kube-apiserver namespace
# - Update cluster operator status
# - Watch nodes and other cluster resources
#
# Note: We allow all egress because the API server IP address and port can vary

# Allow egress to kube-apiserver endpoints.
# The kube-apiserver-operator needs to communicate with kube-apiserver pods to:
# - Manage the kube-apiserver cluster
# - Check kube-apiserver health and status (readyz endpoint)
# - Perform configuration updates
#
# kube-apiserver pods run with hostNetwork: true, which means they bypass
# NetworkPolicy entirely. Since the operator needs to connect to kube-apiserver on the
# host network, we must allow egress to the kube-apiserver port (6443)
# without destination restrictions.
#
# Note: We allow egress on this specific port to any destination because:
# 1. kube-apiserver runs on the host network and is accessed via node IPs
# 2. NetworkPolicy cannot select host-networked pods
# 3. The operator discovers kube-apiserver endpoints dynamically via the API server
